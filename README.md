HOW TO RUN UNIT TESTS:

During the project I ran into dependency issues running Kotlin files with mvn test, so I manually executed the Test suite class by doing the following:

1. In the IntelliJ IDE, right click the src/test directory and mark the directory as the test source
2. run an mvn clean install
3. then go to the MainVerticleTest.kt file
4. Right click and run MainVerticleTest
